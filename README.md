# Project

Firstly, we will host a website on apache web server.
That apache web server will be installed on an Ec2 machine.
And my facebook dummy page code will be on that web server in folder /var/rrot/html
And then in apache conf file
We will change some configuration.
And mention that Ec2 instance ip in our java code.
And one thing we will update the security group of an Ec2 instance by allowing port 80 and 443 traffic for http and https respectively.
